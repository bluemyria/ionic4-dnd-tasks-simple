  <p>
      You can make a sortable by:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>giving each card a <code>DragSource</code> and a <code>DropTarget</code>;</li>
      <li>determining when you are hovering on the upper or lower half of a neighbouring card using <code>monitor.getClientOffset()</code>;</li>
      <li>working out when a reordering is necessary by comparing the index with the item in flight's index;</li>
      <li>bubbling up reordering events, and also beginDrag, endDrag and drop events to a component that controls re-rendering the list; and</li>
      <li>storing a clone of your list to revert to on endDrag, or commit to on drop</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If that sounds like too much effort, this pattern is made easy and
  reusable in <code>@angular-skyhook/sortable</code>. You can do it without introducing a new component, too.</p>
  <p>You can compare the source code of this example to equivalent using that abstraction, Simple list</p>
